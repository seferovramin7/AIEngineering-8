## Task 1: Feature Detective Workflow

This workflow outlines the steps taken to determine the impact of individual features on the Titanic survival prediction model.

1. **Load Titanic Dataset**: Import the dataset into a Pandas DataFrame for analysis.
2. **Feature Engineering**: Create new features such as FamilySize and convert categorical features into numeric format.
3. **Define Features & Target**: Specify the list of input features and the target variable (Survived).
4. **Prepare Data Function**: Develop a function to clean and prepare data subsets for modeling.
5. **Prepare Full Dataset**: Apply the preparation function to the full feature set.
6. **Split Train/Test Data**: Partition the dataset into training and testing sets.
7. **Train Baseline Model**: Build a logistic regression model using all features.
8. **Predict & Compute Accuracy**: Evaluate model accuracy on the test set.
9. **Loop: Remove One Feature**: Iteratively remove each feature, retrain the model, and measure accuracy.
10. **Compare Accuracies**: Analyze the effect of each feature removal on model performance.
11. **Draw Conclusions**: Identify the most and least important features based on accuracy impact.

This systematic approach helps uncover which features contribute most significantly to predicting survival on the Titanic.

## Summary & Reflections

Through this assignment, I deepened my understanding of feature importance, the power of proper age and title engineering, and the pros/cons of different ML models.  
Excited to keep exploring more on data-driven storytelling and model explainability!
